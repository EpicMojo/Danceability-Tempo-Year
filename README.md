# Danceability-Tempo-Year
The purpose of this project is to find the 'danceability' of songs in relation to their tempos and release year.
There are two graphs: one that compares 'danceability' to 'tempo' and one that compares 'danceability' to 'year'.

The dataset was collected from Rodolfo Figueroa on Kaggle. The dataset contains audio features of over 1.2 million songs obtained through the Spotify API. Here's the link to the API documentation: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-audio-features

'tempo' = float value given to each song's tempo

'year' = datetime value given to each song's year of release

'danceability' = float value that shows how danceable a song is

There are no known errors within the dataset or with the process of collecting the raw data. There is a possible bias, considering that the dataset was only made by Spotify.
