# Danceability-Tempo-Year
The purpose of this project is to find the "danceability" of songs in relation to their tempos and year.
There are two graphs: one that compares "danceability" to tempo, and one that compares "danceability" to year.
Data was collected from Rodolfo Figueroa on Kaggle. The dataset contains audio features of over 1.2 million songs obtained through the Spotify API.
